# Spleeter_Unofficial_TF20_MobileApp
Mobile app that consumes the TFLite version of Spleeter_TF2.0_Unofficial version and performs the audio source separation on the edge.

This repo contains the code for Android app that consumes the model generated by the below repository:

https://github.com/VVasanth/SpleeterTF2.0_Unofficial

This android app processes the audio file, generates the features, feeds the features to TFLite model, processes the output of model and generates the audio file from the processed output.

You can use the sample audio files present under the 'sample_audio_files' directory for processing. Please ensure to place the input audio file under the directory 'mnt/sdcard/audio-separator-input' of your emulator, so that code can process the audio file. Processed output would be generated under the directory 'mnt/sdcard/audio-separator-output'.

Right now, entire processing happens and the e2e flow is working. But the results contain lot of noises. I will be working towards optimizing the noises and improving the accuracy in the coming weeks.
